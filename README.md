# 🚀 Hazardous-Asteroid-Prediction

This project focuses on identifying and analyzing potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) using real-time or historical NASA datasets. The goal is to build a pipeline that helps flag asteroids that pose a potential threat to Earth based on parameters like size, velocity, distance from Earth, and more.
